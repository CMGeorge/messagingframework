\title Qt Extended - 4.4.1 Release Notes

\tableofcontents

\section1 Introduction

The Qt Extended 4.4.1 release (also known as Qtopia 4.4) is a feature release of
Qt Extended that is based on Qt 4.4 technology. Note that starting with this release 
Qtopia has been renamed to Qt Extended. The version numbering remains consistent with previous 
Qtopia releases.

The purpose of this release is to publish new Qt Extended API's, to allow
device integrators to begin work on their projects.  This release contains
a number of significant quality issues, which will be corrected in future
patch releases.  Device integrators should not ship this version of Qt
Extended on production devices.

\if !defined(QTOPIA_OPENSOURCE)
Starting with this release, there are no longer separate source packages for different Qt Extended editions.
All source is now provided in a single source package.
\endif


\section1 New Features

\list 1

\o \bold{Build System}
\list
\o This release introduces a new build tool, \bold{QBuild}.  The QBuild tool replaces qmake,
allowing more efficient processing of the build instructions contained in .pro files and better management
of dependencies.
\o Qt Extended no longer supports the previously used concept of Editions.  Editions were a shorthand for specifying the type of user-interface to be used and the default set of projects (modules) to be included in a build.  The UI type and modules are now specified separately.
\o Please see the \l{Build system changes for 4.4.1}{build system changes} page for more detailed information on the build system changes.
\endlist

\o \bold{Cleanup Wizard}
\list
\o Qt Extended now provides a \bold{Cleanup Wizard}, which allows the user to delete old messages, calendar events and documents.  The Cleanup Wizard will automatically be offered to the user if free storage falls below a level set by the device integrator.
\endlist

\o \bold{Document Management}
\list
\o The Documents list now provides a \bold{Rescan System} menu option, which causes the content system to rescan all controlled directories for documents and to repopulate the Documents list with this information.  This allows the user to update the Documents list if they have changed the filesystem contents outside of Qt Extended.
\endlist

\o \bold{Dynamic Rotation}
\list
\o Qt Extended now supports dynamic rotation of the display.  The display can be rotated at runtime by using the Rotation Settings application or in response to hardware events from orientation sensors or slide switches.
\endlist

\o \bold{Fast Load}
\list
\o Qt Extended now supports "fast loading" of selected applications.  Applications marked as FastLoad are launched in the background when Qt Extended starts up.  When the user chooses a FastLoad application from the launcher the application is brought to the foreground, appearing to launch instantly.  The user can select an application for fast loading by choosing \bold{FastLoad} from the Options menu when the application is highlighted in the launcher.
\endlist

\o \bold{First Use Wizard}
\list
\o Qt Extended now provides a \bold{First Use Wizard}, which allows the user to choose the initial Language and Date/Time settings for a device the first time the device is booted.
\endlist

\o \bold{LED Indicator API}
\list
\o This release introduces a new LED Indicator API, providing a set of classes that allow developers to modify the state of a device's LED indicators in a consistent manner.
\endlist

\o \bold{Location API}
\list
\o The release introduces a new Location API, providing a uniform way to access information from GPS receivers.
\endlist

\o \bold{Messaging}
\list
\o The Messages application now allows email accounts to be regularly checked for new messages at a user-configurable interval.  This feature is configured in the Account Settings dialog, where the user may also configure whether interval checking is disabled while roaming to reduce data download costs.
\o If composition of a message is aborted by the user pressing the hangup key to return to the homescreen, the Messages application will offer to resume composing the message the next time it is launched.
\o The Messages application now supports receipt and saving of class 0 (Flash) SMS messages.
\o The Messages applicaiton now supports push email for IMAP servers that support the IDLE extension (RFC2177).
\endlist

\o \bold{Multimedia}
\list
\o Qt Extended now supports rotation of video and fullscreen video playback.
\o The Media Player application now supports display of album cover art.
\o Phonon support is now available in Qt Extended.
\endlist

\o \bold{Pictures}
\list
\o The Pictures application now allows the user to choose a picture to be set as the wallpaper for the Homescreen.
\endlist

\o \bold{Test Framework}
\list
\o This release introduces \bold{QtUiTest}, a framework supporting automated unit-level testing and automated and semi-automated system-level testing.  Unit-level tests are written in C++ and system-level tests can be written in either C++ or QtScript.
A selection of unit-level and system-level test cases are also included in the source package to demonstrate the test framework.
More information on this feature is available in the \l {QtUiTest Manual}.
\endlist

\o \bold{USB}
\list
\o Qt Extended is now able to act as a USB Mass Storage device.
\endlist

\o \bold{Virtual Framebuffer}
\list
\o The Qt Virtual Framebuffer (qvfb) now supports simulation of power management functionality, e.g. screen blanking.
\endlist

\o \bold{WebKit support}
\list
\o Qt Extended now includes support for WebKit.  A sample WebKit-based browser is included for demonstration purposes.
\endlist

\endlist

\section1 Enhancements

\list 1

\o \bold{Camera}
\list
\o The Camera application is now able to write image sensor data to an overlay display.
\endlist

\o \bold{Input Methods}
\list
\o The Predictive Keyboard now supports internationalization.
\endlist

\o \bold{Telephony}
\list
\o The SIM Toolkit now includes support for USAT.
\endlist

\endlist

\section1 Known Issues

\list 1

\o \bold{Build System}
\list
\o BUG 224317: Qt Extended fails to build for an x86_64 target.
\o BUG 221387: The build system is currently unable to build a stand-alone SDK that does not depend on the source or build trees.
\endlist

\o \bold{Contacts}
\list
\o BUG 226400: Creating a contact does not put that contact onto the SIM and the Contacts application provides no means to manually export a contact to the SIM.
\endlist

\o \bold{GoogleTalk}
\list
\o BUG 211938: GTalk does not report connection progress and success/failure.
\endlist

is to introduce the new Qtopia Home Edition, which provides a new User-Interface
for fixed-line, network-enabled telephones.

\section1 New Features

\list 1

\o \bold{Qtopia Home Edition UI and Cubicle Theme}
\list
\o The Smart Simplicity user interface is designed to allow the user to control a device without the need of a stylus, providing support for touchscreen devices with an emphasis on piloting Qtopia with a finger.  Widgets are sized to minimize error touches.
\o The Virtual Navigation Bar is a concept that enables the user to quickly navigate through Qtopia, particularly the high use applications. It also provides quick access to current calls.
\endlist

\o \bold{Telepathy Integration}
Telepathy is a project that aims to provide a unified communications framework based on D-Bus. Qtopia, via Telepathy, provides:
\list
\o Presence
\o Instant Messaging
\o Audio calls
\o Video calls
\endlist

\o \bold{GoogleTalk Integration}
A GoogleTalk account can be defined and provides presence and instant messaging via the Telepathy module.

\o \bold{Mixed conference calls}
The user interface allows two calls to be active at one time, one of which can be a video call.

\endlist

\section1 Enhancements

\list 1

\o \bold{Contacts}
\list
\o On touchscreen-enabled devices, the Contacts list now includes a "fast-find" index that allows the user to search a large list by tapping the first letter of the contact they wish to find.

\o The Messages application now supports checking of email accounts at regular (configurable) intervals.
\o The Messages application now allows marking of multiple messages in folders for bulk operations such as copying, moving and deleting.
\o The Messages application now allows the user to mark individual IMAP folders to be excluded from email synchronization operations.
\o Contact presence for instant messages can now be seen on the inbox list and individual messages.
\o The unified inbox concept enables viewing all sent and received messages of varying types, such as email and instant messages.
\o The message view and composers have been modified with focus for high usability on a touch screen device.
\o Detailed message notifications allow the user to view a message sender, subject and listed attachments without opening the message.
\endlist

\o \bold{Pictures}
\list
\o Pictures now provides a "Save to Contact" feature, which allows the user to associated a picture with a contact.
\o Pictures now provides a "Set as Background" feature, which allows the user to set the Homescreen background.
\endlist

\endlist

\section1 Known Issues

\o BUG 215467: Some applications report application error on using the hard Back key.
\endlist

\o \bold{Internationalization}
\list
\o BUG 215476: Internationalization is not supported in this release. This will be corrected in the 4.4.1 release.
\endlist

\o \bold{Media Player}:
\list

\tableofcontents

\section1 Introduction

The Qtopia 4.3.3 release is a patch release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.3 technology.
The main purpose of this release is to change to using Nokia licenses for commercial packages.
A small number of bug fixes are also included.

Note that for copyright reasons, we are no longer able to ship the Linux Intrusion Detection System
with Qtopia.  As a result of this change, the Safe eXecution Environment (SXE) is no longer
enabled by default for the Greenphone.


\section1 Enhancements

None.

\section1 Bug Fixes

\list 1

\o \bold{Document Management}
\list
\o BUG 226018: Documents were not listed after changing SD cards.
\endlist

\o \bold{Documentation}
\list
\o A number of minor corrections and amendments have been made.
\endlist

\o \bold{OpenMoko Neo1973/Freerunner Device}
\list
\o BUG 220884: When the headset was plugged in, an incoming call would cause the ringtone to be played through the handset instead of the headset.
\endlist

\o \bold{Phone Simulator}
\list
\o BUG 223829: Testing of battery charging using the phone simulator did not work.
\endlist

\o \bold{Qtopia Sync Agent}
\list
\o BUG 217330: DSR was not handled correctly for serial connections and serial connections could not be restarted.
\endlist

\o \bold{Telephony}
\list
\o BUG 220015: "Special" SMS messages, such as as voicemail, were not handled correctly.
\endlist

\endlist

\section1 Known Issues

\list 1

\o \bold{Greenphone}:
\list
\o BUG 171152: Due to a bug in the modem firmware, outgoing calls may not be canceled correctly if the user presses the hangup key while the call is in the "dialing" state.  Qtopia attempts to work around this by attempting to cancel the call after it transitions from "dialing' to "alerting".  This strategy fails in cases where the call transitions directly from "dialing" to "connected".
\o BUG 176936: Due to incorrect factory calibration, some Greenphone handsets do not perform noise cancellation correctly.  This may result in significant levels of echo being heard when using the handset indoors.  This level of echo can be reduced by adjusting the microphone and speaker volumes via the \bold{Call Options} application's \bold{Call Volume} feature. 
\o BUG 179229: The Greenphone modem does not report whether an incoming call has been diverted from another number.  Thus Qtopia is unable to indicate Call Diversion to the user, and the Greenphone therefore fails to achieve GCF Standard Compliance for this function.
\o BUG 180951: On some Greenphones, the Bluetooth subsystem regularly gets into a state where no further Bluetooth operations will succeed until the device is reset.  This is believed to be a fault in the hardware and/or kernel, rather than a problem with the Qtopia software.

\o BUG 197898: When downloading messages via POP, the Messages application would incorrectly indicate to the user that a message had been removed from the server by another user if the server UID was a substring of that of another message.
\endlist

\o \bold{Neo 1973 (ficgta01 device profile)}
\list
\o BUG 178077: If the user attempted to lock the screen via the Home Screen's options menu, the keypad lock was activated instead of the touchscreen lock.

\section1 Known Issues

\list 1

\o \bold{Greenphone}:
\list
\o BUG 171152: Due to a bug in the modem firmware, outgoing calls may not be canceled correctly if the user presses the hangup key while the call is in the "dialing" state.  Qtopia attempts to work around this by attempting to cancel the call after it transitions from "dialing' to "alerting".  This strategy fails in cases where the call transitions directly from "dialing" to "connected".
\o BUG 176936: Due to incorrect factory calibration, some Greenphone handsets do not perform noise cancellation correctly.  This may result in significant levels of echo being heard when using the handset indoors.  This level of echo can be reduced by adjusting the microphone and speaker volumes via the \bold{Call Options} application's \bold{Call Volume} feature. 
\o BUG 179229: The Greenphone modem does not report whether an incoming call has been diverted from another number.  Thus Qtopia is unable to indicate Call Diversion to the user, and the Greenphone therefore fails to achieve GCF Standard Compliance for this function.
\o BUG 180951: On some Greenphones, the Bluetooth subsystem regularly gets into a state where no further Bluetooth operations will succeed until the device is reset.  This is believed to be a fault in the hardware and/or kernel, rather than a problem with the Qtopia software.
\endlist

\section1 Introduction

The Qtopia 4.3.0 release (also known as 4.3 Beta) is a feature release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.3 technology.
The main purpose of this release is to provide APIs for new functionality so that third party
developers and product integrators may begin to write code for Qtopia 4.3.x devices.

\if defined(QTOPIA_OPENSOURCE)
For the first time, this release of Qtopia makes the source code of the full Qtopia telephony stack available
to both commercial and opensource developers under our dual licensing model.  Previously, this code
was only available to commercial customers.

\title Qtopia - 4.2.2 Release Notes

\tableofcontents

\section1 Introduction

The Qtopia 4.2.2 release is a maintenance release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.2 technology.
This release provides a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, both general and
Greenphone-specific.

\section1 Enhancements

\list 1

\o \bold{Bluetooth}
Bluetooth support is provided in this release only as a technology preview.
When building Qtopia, Bluetooth is disabled by default, but may be enabled
by specifying the -bluetooth configure switch.

\o \bold{Clock}
The Clock application has been made consistent with other Qtopia applications by using a tabbed window to present the three different screens rather than using entries in the context menu to switch between the three screens.

\o \bold{Greenphone}
The Greenphone now displays information about its progress during startup and shutdown.

\o \bold{Signal Strength Indication}
The signal strength indicator can now be used to indicate the signal strength of any communications
medium, not just GSM modem signal strength.
This is done by writing appropriate values to the Qtopia Valuespace.  Note that this change requires
minor modifications to all custom themes that display signal strength as described
in \l {Porting Between Qtopia/Qt Extended Versions}{Porting Between Qtopia/Qt Extended Versions}.

\endlist

\o \bold{Input Methods}

\title Qtopia - 4.2.1 Release Notes

\tableofcontents

\section1 Introduction

The Qtopia 4.2.1 release is a maintenance release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4.2 technology.
This release provides a number of bug fixes and performance improvements, both general and
Greenphone-specific.

\section1 Enhancements

\list 1

\o \bold{Bluetooth}
Bluetooth support is provided in this release only as a technology preview.
When building Qtopia, Bluetooth is disabled by default, but may be enabled
by specifying the -bluetooth configure switch.
\list
\o Bluetooth audio now functions on the Greenphone.
\endlist

\o \bold{Calendar}
\list
\o Google Calendar data can be synced to Qtopia.
\o Calendar can now be set to show either month or day view by default.
\o Calendar can now filter events by category.
\endlist

\o \bold{Clock}
\list
\o Date and Time can now be set from the \c Clock application.
\endlist

\o \bold{Look and Feel}
\list
\o A number of widgets have been enhanced to provide a clearer indication
   of whether the widget is in navigation mode or editing mode.  In some cases,
   transitioning between these modes has also been streamlined.
\endlist

\o \bold{Server}
\list
\o Server Widgets for the Home Screen and Launcher may be replaced with custom widgets.
   In a standard Qtopia build, a demonstration of this feature can be accessed via the
   Settings->Server Widgets application.
\o Server Tasks provide a more extensible mechanism to control what and how the
   Qtopia server process starts.  System integrators can register blocks of
   functionality - "tasks" - that the Qtopia server will automatically manage
   and run.
\endlist

\o \bold{Telephony}
\list
\o The level of GCF compliance has been significantly improved.
\endlist

\endlist

\o \bold{Qtopia Server}
\list
\o When changing the language whilst running Qtopia on a desktop using qvfb the Qtopia server will shutdown but will not restart automatically.

On de desktop this behaviour is not desirable, therefore qvfb needs to be manually restarted.

\title Qtopia - 4.1.0 Release Notes

\tableofcontents

\section1 Introduction

The Qtopia 4.1.0 release is the first exciting release of Qtopia that is based on Qt 4 technology.
The main task for this first release has been to port Qtopia 2.x code to work with the new Qt 4 API.

\section1 Enhancements

\list 1
\o \bold{802.11 Wireless IP support}
 
The existing functionality has been completely rewritten and new features have been added- in particular support for roaming and rule-based network selection.

\o \bold{Appearance}
 
Usability has been improved, that is:
\list
\o currently selected items are highlighted 
\o the user can choose a display style from the menu bar
\o selection is effective immediately so the user receives visual feedback about the choice.
\endlist

\o \bold{Bidirectionality}

Qtopia 4 is able to provide user interfaces that work for right-to-left (RTL) languages, such as Arabic and Hebrew. All user interface elements including text and widgets will support bidirectional layouts.

\o \bold{Bluetooth}
 
\list
\o Support for GAP, SDAP and OPP profiles.
\o GAP support includes authentication and pairing functionality.
\o  OBEX Object PUSH client implementation.
\o  OBEX Object Push server implementation.
\o  Support of Bluetooth Obex VCard send/receive in the \c addressbook application.
 
\endlist

\o \bold{Calculator}
 
A separate calculator library has been integrated into the application for simplicity.

\o \bold{Call Forwarding}

Improved usability includes: 
    \list 1
    \o allow user to select the type of the call first and then forwarding conditions
    \o cache forwarding information to reduce waiting time for the user
    \o suggest a previously used number before displaying \c Contacts
    \o allow user to type number as well as selecting a number from \c Contacts
    \o provide feedback when a provided phone number is not valid.
    \endlist

\o \bold{Digital Rights Management}
 
OMA DRM v1 Forward Lock (FL) compliance is enabled by means of a 3rd-party DRM solution. Files and content subject to Digital Rights Management are able to be transparently (to the user) browsed, launched, moved, deleted and examined for their properties in the same way as other files. File operations for example copy, move, rename will be handled via the \c QContentMetaInfo API and will follow OMA DRM standards for DRM controlled files.

\o \bold{Document Management}
 
The Documents API has been completely rewritten and provides a more sophisticated media management such as playlists, supporting MP3 ID3 tags, EXIF tags in JPEG photos etc.

\o \bold{GPRS}
 
The existing functionality has been largely rewritten and now provides a much better structure and easier debugging facilities.

\o \bold{Helix}
 
An initial integration of Helix has been implemented.

\bold{Note:}
\list
\o When Helix is enabled at configure, the Qtopia media player acts as a media
server and all sounds are played through it.

\o If Helix is not enabled at configure the Qtopia media player will not be present and sounds are played using the Qtopia Core sound server (QSS).
\endlist


\o \bold{Internationalization}
 
Two new languages have been added, Arabic (ar) and Korean (ko).

\o \bold{Internet}
 
 Added routing support, that is,  the user can have several internet connections at the same time.

\o \bold{Launcher}
 
Improved modularity by loosening the cohesion between \c HomeScreen, \c PhoneLauncher and \c PhoneManager.

\o \bold{Multitasking}
 
A phone-centric user interface for multitasking is provided. The user is now able to:
    \list 1
    \o launch another application by pressing the \c Home key to return to home screen without terminating current application.
    \o switch between previously launched applications by multi-pressing the \c Home key to cycle between all applications and the home screen.
    \o terminate current application by the normal use of the \c Back button.
    \endlist

\o \bold{Music/Videos}
 
Multimedia applications have been redesigned to use Helix DNA as the basic foundation and to provide playlist support. Improved support and performance can be expected for the following formats:
    \list 1
    \o AAC and aacPlus
    \o AMR-NB and AMR-WB
    \o H.263
    \o MP3
    \o MPEG4
    \o RealAudio and RealVideo
    \endlist
 
In addition support for the following streamed formats are expected:
    \list 1
    \o AAC and aacPlus
    \o MP3
    \o RealAudio and RealVideo
    \endlist

\o \bold{PIM}
 
All PIM application now make use of an SQL database for all content.

\o \bold{Pictures}
 
The user can create photo playlists for slideshows and play background music while viewing the slideshow.

\o \bold{Plug-ins}
 
Plug-ins have been redesigned to suit the new Qt plug-in mechanism.

\o \bold{Profiles}
